  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 'Software engineer with 4 years of experience working in backend development. I describe myself as a very adaptive and self-motivated
    person. From working on consulting on big projects with a lot of people, passing to product development with high emphasis in quality, and
    finally in a small startup with a “move fast, break things'' philosophy, I’m always comfortable with any challenge, and I’ll be able to face it
    autonomously and self-sufficiently. <br>Although I’m capable of working alone and owning a part of a product development, I love the feeling of
    working in a team, and I think that humor is a key to success at work.
